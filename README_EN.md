## Translation Technology Explanation

This repository employs advanced AI translation technology to provide a more user-friendly experience for Chinese users:

- **Feature Introduction Translation**: Based on the Zhipu AI large model ([https://bigmodel.cn/](https://bigmodel.cn/))
- **Document Processing Tool**: Using ai-markdown-translator ([https://github.com/h7ml/ai-markdown-translator](https://github.com/h7ml/ai-markdown-translator)) for intelligent conversion of Markdown documents

⚠️ Friendly Reminder:  
Due to the use of machine translation, there may be slight differences in some technical terms or expressions.
